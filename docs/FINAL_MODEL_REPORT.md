- Learning rate scheduling worked effectively
- Loss components balanced appropriately
- No signs of catastrophic forgetting or mode collapse

### Architecture Benefits
- Residual connections help with gradient flow
- Separate heads for keypoints and presence allow specialized learning
- Dropout (0.3) provides good regularization
- Hidden dimension (128) provides sufficient capacity

## 📈 Performance Comparison

### Against Fine-tuning Attempt
